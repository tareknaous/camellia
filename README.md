# Camellia: Benchmarking Cultural Biases in LLMs for Asian Languages

This repository contains the entities and masked contexts of the Camellia dataset for measuring cultural biases in LLMs for Asian languages.

For more details, see the accompanying paper:

## Cultural Entities

The folder ```entities``` contains the entities for 6 different entity types, annotated for association with each Asian culture (```Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Indian```) or ```Western``` culture.

## Masked Contexts

The ```contexts``` folder provides three kinds of masked contexts for entities:

- ```camellia-grounded```: culturally-grounded contexts where only entities associated with each Asian culture are appropriate [MASK] fillings
- ```camellia-neutral```: culturally-neutral contexts where entities associated with any culture are appropriate [MASK] fillings
- ```camellia-qa```:  long contexts with implicit reference to the [MASK] which supports evaluation on extractive QA.

All contexts entities are paired with an English translation.
